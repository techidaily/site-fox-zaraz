For tackling its popularity, another tech giant Microsoft has built its latest browser **Microsoft Edge,** on the same engine on which Google Chrome is based – Chromium.

Although, even after being so widespread among the users, Chrome is not free of issues. One of the prevalent issues that users report is **Chrome using too much CPU**.

Historically, Chrome is often said to be a browser that uses a lot of RAM and other computer resources. Users usually term it as the most demanding web browser. However, mostly it is not the Chrome browser that is causing the CPU problem; instead, the root of the problem may be the way how you are using it.

In this article, we would discuss the possible issues and their fixes that are causing Google Chrome to use too much CPU.

## How to Check Google Chrome CPU Usage?

To check Google Chrome’s CPU usage, you do not need to download any third-party CPU monitoring application. Windows Task Manager would be enough to provide you the required details.

1. Right-click on the taskbar and choose the **Task Manager** to open it.![Open Task Manager](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Open-Task-Manger.png)
2. Look for Google Chrome and click on its icon. If you find multiple icons, click on any of them and check its **memory** and **GPU** usage.![Task Manager Google Chrome](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Task-Mnager-Google-Chrome.png)

## Common Signs of High CPU usage by Chrome

When Chrome starts using high system resources, there would be unusual symptoms indicating that.

* Your webpage screen would lag while scrolling.
* If you are using a laptop, then its battery would drain faster than usual.
* Your screen would periodically freeze.
* Your system would get heat up, and the fan would create a louder noise than usual.
* Opening any other application would take much more time than usual.
* The mouse would also start lagging.

If you are experiencing any or several of these issues, then there is definitely a problem with the Chrome browser using too much CPU power.

## What causes Chrome to Use more RAM?

For curing the problem, first, we have to find out what is causing it. Though it is the browser with lots of advanced features and tools, we cannot put full blame just on the browser for high memory usage. There could be many other factors that may be prompting Google Chrome to use more RAM. Let us list them:

* The most apparent reason could be the **opening of multiple tabs or windows at the same time**. Whenever you open a new tab or a new window, a new process gets started.
* **Too many browser extensions or add-ons active at the same time**. You might not notice that you have added a lot of web extension and add-ons to your Chrome browser. Most of them are always active and functioning even though you don’t require them or don’t use them. There are more problems associated with the web extensions, which we would discuss later in the article.
* **Streaming the High Definition videos** on YouTube and other websites may also cause high RAM and GPU usage, especially on your low-end device.
* **A Malware attack** can also cause high RAM usage from Chrome. Cybercriminals use many tricks to inject browser viruses like [hijackers](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/), [adware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/), [keyloggers](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/), and others to infiltrate your browser settings, causing misbehavior of the Chrome browser.
* Chrome also comes with an **in-built antimalware tool** that can also create unusual usage of computing power.

## Fixes for Chrome Using Too Much CPU

As you can see, it is not always the browser that is the culprit of high CPU usage. We would now discuss what are the possible fixes to that.

### **Check Chrome Task Manager**

For those of you who don’t know, Google Chrome comes with an in-built task manager that monitors the amount of memory used by Chrome’s web extension, add-ons, processes, and web pages. You can easily access it an catch the culprit that is causing high CPU usage in Chrome.

1. Open Chrome and click on the three dots at the top-right corner.
2. Hover cursor to **More tools** option and select **Task manager.**![Open chrome task manager](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Open-chrome-task-manager.png)
3. A new window will open. You can see all the processes going on Chrome. Every opened webpage, every extension being used.

### **Disable or Delete Unneccesary Web Extensions**

In the previous section, when you opened the Google Chrome Task Manager, you might have noticed many web extensions running in the background, even though they are not in use.

Here are a few problems with Chrome web extensions: 

* Some Chrome extensions are poorly coded, so their processing demand is high despite the fact that their task is not that heavy.
* Some extensions that are outdated might cause loops in the script, making the web extensions run indefinitely even after their job gets completed.
* It is a possibility that you might have downloaded two or more extensions that perform the same role. It might cause conflict among them, causing high RAM usage.

If you have many web extensions installed in your Chrome browser, it is time to sort them out and at least disable, if not delete, the ones you rarely use. However, it is recommended to remove the useless web extensions instead of disabling them. Because, even after disabling them, they might use the CPU processing power while checking for updates and performing updates.

[Where are Chrome Extensions Stored](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)

There might be many extensions that are necessary for your tasks. Always make sure to check for updates regularly.

Here are the steps to manage the web extensions on the Chrome Browser:

1. Click on the three dots at the top-right corner.
2. Bring mouse cursor over **More tools** and from the extended menu choose **Extensions**.![Extensions settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Extensions-settings.png)
3. All the extensions would be on your screen
4. Now, look for the ones you want to disable or remove.![manage chrome extensions](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/manage-chrome-extensions.jpg)

### **Disable Background Tasks in Chrome**

Since Google Chrome is an advanced web browser, it comes with some features that require background running; for example, the **[push notification](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)** feature needs to be active throughout to look for the new activity.

However, if you have a low-end system and want to reduce the Chrome computation requirement, you can disable the background tasks in Chrome.

1. Open Chrome settings by clicking on the three dots at the top-right corner.![Open Settings in Chrome](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Open-Settings-in-Chrome.jpg)
2. Scroll down and click on **Advanced** to open advanced settings. ![Click on Advanced in Chrome](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Click-on-Advanced-in-Chrome.jpg)
3. Under the system tab, disable the “**Continue running background apps when Google Chrome is closed”** option.![Chrome system settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chrome-system-settings.jpg)

### **Turn off the Hardware Acceleration**

Hardware Acceleration helps your system in sharing the processing load between the CPU and GPU. Hardware Acceleration handles most of the graphical part in the Chrome browser like playing videos from Youtube or other sites, playing animation, online browser-based gaming, and others.

Since GPU is better in handling graphics, so it is good to keep the Hardware Acceleration On. However, several users have reported otherwise. Their Chrome browser works better when Hardware Acceleration is kept off. The result may not be the same for you, but there is no harm in giving a try.

To turn off Hardware Acceleration:

1. Open Chrome Browser.
2. Then, navigate to **Settings->Advanced**
3. Under the system tab, toggle the button next to “**Use hardware acceleration when available”** to turn it off.![Disable Hardware Acceleration](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Disable-Hardware-Acceleration.png)

### **Scan Your System for Malware**

It might be possible that malware like Browser Hijacker, Adware, or [malicious pop-up ads](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) have got an entry on your browser that is causing Google Chrome to use more computation power than usual.

You can check and [remove those malicious programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) using three ways.

#### **Using Chrome’s in-built Malware Scanner**

Many people are unaware that Chrome comes with an in-built antimalware. You can use it to find out the malicious extension or program that is troubling the browser’s working.

## FAQs: Chrome Using too much CPU

**1\. Is Chrome slowing down my computer?** 

If you use too many extensions and apps on Google Chrome and have a habit of opening multiple tabs and windows while working on Chrome, then you are prompting Chrome to use extra CPU power and thus slowing down your computer.

**2\. Is Chrome better than Firefox?** 

Both the browser are good in their own way, but Chrome is more popular because of its extra features like a vast webstore for web extensions and apps. However, Chrome lacks in privacy where Firefox is much better.

**3\. Can too many bookmarks slow down Chrome?** 

NO, adding any number of the bookmark will not slow down your Chrome browser. However, if you keep on opening the new tabs or windows, it would impact the CPU usage, and the performance would also be affected.
