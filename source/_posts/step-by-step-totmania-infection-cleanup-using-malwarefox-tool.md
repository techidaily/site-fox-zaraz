## What is Totmania?

Totmania is a kiddish website claiming to help you find the name of the person you love. 

To reveal the name of your love, you must send out the pre-made message to 10 people. This message contains a link to Totmania website which doesn’t spreads itself. 

Totmania is harmful only when you send out messages to ten users manually. 

Owners of the Totmania site mislead gullible kids and naive internet users into believing that it can find them the love of their life. Hence, it can be categorised as a Spam or social engineering attack.
