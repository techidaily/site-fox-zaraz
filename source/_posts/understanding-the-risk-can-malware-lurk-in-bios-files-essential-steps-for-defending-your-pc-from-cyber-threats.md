## How Malware Hides in BIOS?

The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is a type of firmware that is used to start up your computer. It is responsible for initializing all the hardware components in your system, including the CPU, memory, and storage devices. Malware can hide in BIOS by infecting the bootloader. The bootloader is a small program that loads the operating system into memory. If the bootloader is infected with malware, it can infect the rest of your system, including the BIOS.

It is extremely challenging to get rid of BIOS malware; thankfully, they are pretty rare. In most cases, malware that hides in BIOS is designed to target specific systems, such as those used in military or industrial applications. However, there have been a few instances of BIOS malware being used in attacks against regular consumers.

## What are the Signs of BIOS Malware Attack?

There are a few signs that may indicate that your BIOS has been infected with malware.

* One of the most common symptoms is a computer that fails to boot up. This can be caused by the bootloader being corrupted or deleted. If you see an error message saying “Invalid Boot Disk” or “No Boot Device Found”, it is likely that your bootloader has been infected.
* Another common sign of BIOS malware is sudden and unexpected changes in BIOS settings. If you notice that your computer’s clock is suddenly set to the wrong time or date, or that other settings have been changed, it is possible that your BIOS has been infected.
* If your computer’s behavior appears to be caused by a virus but your virus scans turn up clean, there’s a good chance you have a BIOS infection.
